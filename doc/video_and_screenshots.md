Third version was created because of the problems with the steering (cheap remote controled cars have low quality gears inside). 
Also, in the previous version, any manipulation of the circuits, was difficult because of the casing. 
Also it was difficult to get good odometry readout. 

So i changed the body of the car as well as the wheels. 
Looks a bit worse, but is waaaaay more effective ;]
