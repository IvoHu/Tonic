## List of components


- [Pololu MinIMU-9 v5] ~20$ - It does not need to be a exact match, but you will have to modify the code to cover it.
- [Pi Camera](https://www.amazon.com/kuman-Raspberry-Camera-Module-OV5647/dp/B06XKLLT6G/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1544007564&sr=8-5&keywords=pi+camera+zero) with connecting tape ~ 16$ - You need specifically this connecting tape for pi zero, as it is different than for other raspberry versions
- [camera case](https://www.amazon.com/components-Latest-Raspberry-Camera-Megapixel/dp/B00IJZJKK4/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&qid=1544007656&sr=8-15&keywords=pi+camera+case) this camera case, or you can 3Dprint one.
-  - [sunny connector for camera](https://botland.com.pl/moduly-i-zestawy-raspberry-pi-zero/8764-adapter-do-kamery-dla-raspberry-pi-zero.html?search_query=pi+zero&results=64)
- [Li-Pol Redox 900mAh 20C 3S 11,1V](https://botland.com.pl/akumulatory-li-pol-3s-111v-/8320-pakiet-li-pol-redox-900mah-20c-3s-111v.html) - I could not find that part on amazon, but battery with simmilar specs could do, but you might need to change the connector
- [Charger for battery](https://botland.com.pl/ladowarki-lipol-sieciowe/1240-ladowarka-redox-lipo-z-zasilaczem.html)
- [L298 - Dual Drive control](https://www.amazon.com/Qunqi-Controller-Module-Stepper-Arduino/dp/B014KMHSW6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1544008236&sr=8-1&keywords=l298) ~ 7$
-  - Pair of T-DEAN connectors
- for RPI0 [GPIO pins](https://www.amazon.com/DIKAVS-Break-Away-2x20-pin-Header-Raspberry/dp/B075VNBD3R/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1544008428&sr=8-4&keywords=gpio+raspberry+pi+zero) you may find already in some raspberry pi zero sets
- some [connecting cables](https://www.amazon.com/Elegoo-EL-CP-004-Multicolored-Breadboard-arduino/dp/B01EV70C78/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1544008389&sr=8-3&keywords=gpio+wires)
- something like this [chassis](https://www.amazon.com/d/Robotics-Kit/diymore-Chassis-Encoder-Battery-Arduino/B01LWYUQPH/ref=sr_1_fkmr2_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1544653043&sr=8-3-fkmr2&keywords=chassis+Rectangle+2WD) to mount everythin with a pair of wheels with motors
- something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Waveshare-Photo-Interrupter-Sensor-Measuring/dp/B01N0FQ21B/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1544653159&sr=8-1&keywords=waveshare+photo+interrupter)

## How to build this

### First build the chassis 
This should be pretty intuitive.

### Next mount the camera
Mount Imu as well.

## Mount the battery and on switch

### Mount the drive control and RPI0

## Connecting the wires
